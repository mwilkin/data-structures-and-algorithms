# Challenge Summary

Implement Queues by using two Stack internally and only the methods available to Stacks.

## Challenge Description

Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

`enqueue(value)` which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

`dequeue()` which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

The Stack instances have only `push`, `pop`, and `peek` methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### Example 



Feature Tasks
On your main file, create…
C#: a method called public static bool MultiBracketValidation(string input)
JavaScript: a function called multiBracketValidation(input)
Python: a function called multi_bracket_validation(input)
Java: a method public static boolean multiBracketValidation(String input)
Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}

Example

Input	Output
{}	TRUE
{}(){}	TRUE
()[[Extra Characters]]	TRUE
(){}[[]]	TRUE
{}{Code}[Fellows](())	TRUE
[({}]	FALSE
(](	FALSE
{(})	FALSE
Consider these small examples and why they fail.

Input	Output	Why
{	FALSE	error unmatched opening { remaining.
)	FALSE	error closing ) arrived without corresponding opening.
[}	FALSE	error closing }. Doesn’t match opening (.
