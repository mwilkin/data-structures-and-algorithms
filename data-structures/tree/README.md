# Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree Data Structures

Explore Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees Data Structures.

## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

### Create a BinaryTree class

Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called `preOrder`, `inOrder`, and `postOrder` which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

Write a `breadth first traversal` method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.

### Create a BinarySearchTree class

Define a method named `add` that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

Define a method named `contains` that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
