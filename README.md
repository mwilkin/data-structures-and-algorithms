## Repository for 301d2 class challenges
----

### This repo will be used for class challenges throughout 301 and 401, which will be posted daily by the instructor.

### All challenges will be worked on with pair programming and will be focused on from 4PM-5PM, completing as much as possible during this time. 

### The remainder will be completed on our own, as needed.
